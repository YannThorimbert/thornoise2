# thornoise2
Library for making noise in Python and C.

The mathematical model, based on fractal combination of splines,
is described here : https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03525

To run the example, go in thornoise2's parent folder and type:
'python -m thornoise2.examples.example_numpygen'

A more pedagogical code is available in purepython, but it is slower:
'python -m thornoise2.examples.example_purepython'
